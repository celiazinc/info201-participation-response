# Participation Journal
The purpose of this journal is to help you track your progress in the INFO 201 course. Because of the configuration on GitHub, you should be able to view a hosted (website) version of this journal at `info201b-w19.github.io/participation-YOUR-USER-NAME`. That website will host the rendered version of this `README.md` file. You will also be able to view additional files you create at the corresponding extension (e.g., when you create a `week-1.md` file, you will be able to view it at `info201b-w19.github.io/participation-YOUR-USER-NAME/week-1`).

Each week, you will add a new journal entry in a new markdown file that you create (i.e., `week-1.md`). You will **submit a link** to that _hosted website_ to canvas to earn points in the course. 

You are encouraged to use the `weekly-template.md` file, but if you have a preferred format, please let us know. Each week, you should also update this `README.md` file to add a link to the week to the list below.

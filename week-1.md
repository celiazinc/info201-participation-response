# Week one  

## Exercises
In this section, you should provide a **bulleted list** of **links** to exercise chapters you worked on this week. At a minimum, we expect to see substantial progress on the exercises discussed in class (remember, you should be pushing commits to the work you are doing in the `book-exercises-USER-NAME/` repository). For each link (chapter), include a brief note about which skills are covered in the exercise (this will be helpful to come back to!). Feel free to link to the entire chapter, or a specific exercise. For example:

- [Chapter 2](exercise 1): _https://github.com/info201b-w19/exercises-celiazinc.git_ In this exercise I get to review all the useful command lines.
- [Chapter 3](exercise 1):practised my git commands line and MarkDown code.

## New Skills and Challenges
I have learned to use command line, and I think it is really conviences, since I have a really messed up file orginazations. Also I learned about the MarkDown format, and I think it is easy and useful.
The challenges could be that I did not know to bring computers to class, so I was having a hard time at home follow up to learn how to use commandline to complete the homework. But I finally git it down.
And I think command line need more practices, since I only know some basic commands, and I think I should explore more.

## Specific Code Sections
In this section, add _at least_ 3 code blocks containing code that you found helpful this week. This is your opportunity to keep track of syntax/code skeletons so you can easily come back to them for future use! Make sure to use **code block formatting** and **include comments** with the code. Feel free to also include images, links, or other content that makes this more useful for you!

**Comment lines**
```r
cd.. <- "go to the upper file, the last file, go up"
```
**MarkDown Style**
```
**Bold**
_Italic_
#Headers
##subHeader
```

**Version Control**
```r
git status <- "check weather the file is under check for each version"
git add <- "add all the versions"
git commits <- "add a headers"
git push <- "upload the file to github"
```


## Goals for the upcoming week
What are your goals for the upcoming week? Are there any questions that you have that you hope to answer in the coming week?They can be specific and technical (e.g., _practice XX_) or general and more personal (e.g., _work more efficiently on homeworks_). Again, the format here is up to you -- this is also a great place to express your goals and areas of confusion to the TAs so they can provide better support!

> my **Goals** next week is to learn about R, and get to familiar with the RStudio
> I also want to be more familiar with the command lines.

_Question_ My question is that becuase my computer language is set to Chineses, and my dociment's
 name is chinese, so I do not know how to do commends on those Chinese characters named files.
